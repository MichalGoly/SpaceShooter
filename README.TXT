## HOW TO PLAY
Use keyboard arrows to control the space craft and score as many points as possible
by shooting up meteors and enemies. The conservation of momentum has been incorporated
into the game by allowing meteors to bump off each other. The preservation
of momentum is also visible when player crashes into both the enemies and the meteors
themselves. Laser bullets, by the design choice, have no mass therefore they melt down
the obstacles.

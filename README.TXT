## SPACE SHOOTER
Developed by Michal Goly (mwg2@aber.ac.uk)

## HOW TO PLAY
Use keyboard arrows to control the space craft and score as many points as possible
by shooting up meteors and enemies. The conservation of momentum has been incorporated
into the game by allowing meteors to bump into each other. The preservation
of momentum is also visible when player crashes either into the enemies or the meteors
themselves. Laser bullets  have no mass therefore they melt down the obstacles.
